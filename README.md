#### Installation
This game was written using Python version 3.8.2 and pygame version 1.9.6. In order to install this version of pygame< type within your command prompt:
```bash
    pip install pygame==1.9.6
```
If you already have another pygame version installed, the code may run fine, but backwards compatibility has not been tested.

#### Get Playin'
In order to start playing the game you need to be running python in the directory within which the game is located. Simply type:
```python
>>> GameStart()
```
and the game window should initiate!

This highly complex game is not for the feable-minded. So tred carefully while glancing over the following game-play instructions...
| Action | Key |
|--------|-----|
| move right | right arrow key |
| move left | left arrow key |
And that's it! Stunningly easy, I know ;)
